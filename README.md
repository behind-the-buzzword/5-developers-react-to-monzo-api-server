# #5 - Developers React To Monzo API (Server)

![Behind the Buzzword](behind-the-buzzword-logo.jpeg)

## Overview

The purpose of this server is to enable the React Native mobile app to request an access token by providing an authorization code. This *could* be done on the React Native app, but that would expose the OAuth secret.

## How to deploy

You will need to have created an OAuth client on the Monzo developer portal, as these credentials are required when deploying to your Heroku account.
